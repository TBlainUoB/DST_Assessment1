    "When working with a dataset that has a class imbalance, stratified k-fold can be especially useful. This is because a dataset with a class imbalance can cause the model to be biased towards the majority class, and the evaluation of the model may be misleading if the folds are not representative of the class distribution in the dataset. By using stratified k-fold cross-validation, the model can be trained and evaluated on balanced folds, which can provide more accurate estimates of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also wish to acknowledge the issue of overfitting, so we set early stopping times and iterate this process of generating our predictions by averaging over different folds and furthermore averaging the whole process over different seeds. Taking only our best folds would overfit here. Using multiple models trained with different random seeds will have slightly different parameter values and will make slightly different predictions. Averaging the predictions of these models can help smooth out any overfitting that may have occurred in individual models,"
