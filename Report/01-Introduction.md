# Introduction


Inaccuracies in car insurance companies’ claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. If insurance companies can pridict the claim rate of drivers more accurately, it will allow them to tailor their prices further. And hence, they will not lose profit by setting the price too low and lose customers by setting the price too high. In this project, we use the dataset from Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, and try to build models that predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. 

The dataset can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data. 



We found that the test dataset on Kaggle does not contain labels, so we have to split the train dataset into new test dataset and new train dataset. And we need to keep the test dataset.
