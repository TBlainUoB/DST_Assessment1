# Introduction


Inaccuracies in car insurance companies’ claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones. It does not seem fair that one has to pay so much if he/she has been cautious on the road for years. Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees. 

In this project, we will build models that predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year in Porto Seguro. A more accurate prediction will allow them to tailor their prices further, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.
